How to use the program:

Initial steps:
  1. Load a desired file using the LOAD button
  2. Enter the desired number of displayed iterations in the
     "NUMBER OF ITERATIONS" field and press the green button

Navigating the iterations:
     To get to a specific iteration it is recommended to turn off
     the animation by unchecking the "ANIMATION" checkbox.
     Then you can either use the "NEXT" and "PREVIOUS" buttons
     to navigate the iterations or enter the desired iteration into
     the "SHOW ITERATION NUMBER" and press the green set button

Saving the iterations:
     You can either save a specific iteration or save the last
     iteration that was calculated. To save a specific iteration,
     the iteration must be shown on the display, and the
     "SAVE CURRENT" button must be pressed. To save the last
     calculated iteration, press the "SAVE" button.
     
File format:
    The format of the file must look like this:
    [boardRows] [boardColumns]
    TypeOfElement1 [rows] [columns]
    TypeOfElement2 [rows] [columns]
    Where rows and columns must be natural numbers from the range <1, 600>
    TypeOfElement must be a word from the list:
    -Conductor
    -ElectronHead
    -ElectronTail
    -Diode
    -DiodeReversed
    -XORGate
    -Generator
    -ORGate
    IMPORTANT: Bare in mind the size of each element, if you put an element that doesn't fit onto the board
    the file won't load.
    IMPORTANT: If the file doesn't load, please check if you didn't leave empty line in the end of the file.
